# BLG335-Homework-Solutions
ITU BLG 335E Analysis of Algorithms Homework solutions (not perfect).
I provided the given homework explanation pdfs alongside.

HW1: 70/70 (Got an email saying the deduction was about the report only but no further detail was shared)

HW2: 70/70 (Code a(15p) : 15 , b(15p) : 15 , c(10p) : 10 , d(20p) : 20 , e(10p) : 10)

HW3: 69/75 (RBT Implementation(30p) : 28.0, BST Implementation(10p) : 8.0, Correct Results(25p) : 23.0, Ordered Input(10p) : 10)
(IDK where the problem was exactly, the tests were not shared)

I provided my reports too but i have no detail on what is wrong and all 3 of them had 5-6 point deductions.
